## What is SDDEKit?

A library for stochastic delay differential equations implementing published
numerical schemes, utilities for constructing network models and handling
simulation results, as well as bindings for MATLAB, Python.  Our intent is
to make it possible to use and benchmark available schemes on your favorite
model, not invent new numerical schemes, so we have attempted to follow
published results, documenting caveats, assumptions etc. Care will be taken to
handle calculation of partial erivatives, to enable higher order schemes,
optimization and inversion techniques.

*This is project is currently under heavy development; not for use pending v0.1 release*.
