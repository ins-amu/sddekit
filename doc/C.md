We have a few opinions on how to write C, starting with the C99 standard.

- use interfaces (`struct`s of function pointers) + constructors as much as possible in API
- common code or data? _composition over inheritance_ make a private header with struct / functions, or an interface if useful
- stick to `double`, `uint32_t` & `bool` or custom types in API

From 9, 

> Boilerplate works best when libraries are expected to cater to all tastes, but sometimes there is just too much duplication. Itâ€™s time to wrap your flexible library with one that has opinions on policy, workflow, and state. Building simple-to-use APIs is about turning your boilerplate into a library.

is a good point, and libtvb should provide two levels of apis. The current work provides the highly verbose API and later on a second opinionated API can be placed on top.

10 has a few interesting tidbits, such as 
```c
struct POINT { int x, y; };
struct POINT *p;
p = &(struct POINT) {1, 1};
p->x = 2;
p->y = 2;
printf("*p = %d, %d\n", p->x, p->y);
```
in other words, compound literals are lvalues with addresses.

## typedefing

I was fairly convinced by the points [made by Linus](http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/typedefs.html) that `typedef`ing generally hurts readability, so I'd prefer not using it.

## Aliasing and mutation

Rust makes a good case, but fundamentally they are baking a few best practices into their compiler: avoid simultaneous aliasing and mutation. In C99, excluding these can be obtained via the `restrict` and `const` keywords respectively, but I found tightening it all down was just too verbose

```c
struct foo {
    const double * const restrict
        (* const get_values)(const struct foo * const restrict self);
};
```

The first and second `const` keeps you from changing elements pointed at by `values` or the memory address in `values` respectively. It also promises that no other pointer accesses the same memory as that accessed by `values`. Great guarantees, but heavy to write out.

One option would be `typedef` again
```c
typedef const double * const restrict doubles;

bool all_equal(uint32_t n, doubles x, doubles y);
```
but this hides the pointer etc etc.
