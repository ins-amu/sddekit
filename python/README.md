# Python ctypes binding to SDDEKit

`sddekit.py` is a thin wrapper around `_sddekit.py`, a file of ctypes
style signatures autogenerated by ctypesgen.

`run_ctypesgen.py` should be used to generate the Python 2 file and `2to3`
to generate `_sddekit3.py`, a Python 3 style file.

Eventually, Python 2/3 compatibility should be fixed in ctypesgen, which
appears to (currently) be a stagnant project.
